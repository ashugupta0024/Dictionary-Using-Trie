Introduction
Project : Implementing a Dictionary using Trie Data Structure
A trie is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually string.
Features of the Project :
1. Search for a word(Also offers autocomplete feature)
2. Find Meaning of a Word
3. Insert new words into dictionary
4. Remove words from the dictionary

Running the Program:

The Words in the Dictionary is stored in a word file named "wordlist.txt" along with the meaning which we have also attached along with the code.
We have entered some word  in the text file for working of the project and your reference.
While entering meaning of the word when you are inserting a word in dictionary please don't use spaces.
For Ex:
Suppose While entering meaning of word "evaporator" input meaning as : "piece_of_equipment_used_to_evaporate" instead of "piece of equipment used to evaporate".
